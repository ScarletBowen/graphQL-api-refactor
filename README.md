# graphQL-api-refactor

In this web app, I refactored a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, so that it is a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. 

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, type "npm i" in the terminal.

## Dependencies Used
    - bcrypt
    - apollo-server-express
    - connect-session-sequelize
    - express
    - graphql
    - jsonwebtoken
    - mongoose
    - npm
    - bookstrap
    - @apollo/client
    - jwt-decode

## Instructions

When the site first launches, users will have the ability to search for books, but will not be able to save any unless they create an account first. To create an account, click 'Login/Sign Up' and follow the instructions. Once an account is created, you will be redirected to the homepage at which point you can search and save books. The user can view any books they have saved by clicking 'See Your Books' on the top right of the page. Once viewing the saved books, users will be able to remove any books from their collection by clicking 'remove'.
